  <h1>FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY</h1>
  <h2 id="year">(1821 ‚Äì 1881)</h2>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Fyodor Dostoevsky" class="portrait">

  <p><em>In a cold Moscow winter of 1821, a boy named <strong>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky</strong>  
    was born to a stern military doctor. His childhood was modest and tense, yet filled with a restless curiosity about life and people. 
    As a young man, he trained to be an engineer, but the pull of ideas and words proved stronger.
    One fateful day in 1849, his world collapsed‚Äîarrested for speaking too freely in a political circle, he stood before a firing squad,
   staring into the face of death. At the last moment, the execution was halted; his sentence changed to years of brutal labor in the 
   frozen wastes of Siberia. Those years carved deep lines into his soul, teaching him the weight of suffering and the flicker of hope 
   that survives it. He returned to the world forever changed, carrying scars both seen and unseen. Life never spared him‚Äîpoverty, 
   illness, and loss followed him until his final days. Yet, from that life of hardship, he left behind an unshakable legacy, 
   one that still speaks to the deepest truths of the human heart.</em></p>

   <h2>Tribute</h2>
  <p><em>Fyodor Dostoevsky remains a towering figure in the world of literature, a writer whose words pierce to the very depths of the
     human soul. His works are not merely stories, but profound journeys into the complexities of morality, suffering, love, and 
     redemption. Through the trials of his own life‚Äîpoverty, imprisonment, illness‚Äîhe forged an unflinching understanding of human 
     nature, portraying both its darkest shadows and its brightest moments of grace. Dostoevsky‚Äôs novels challenge, awaken, 
     and comfort, reminding us that even in despair there is hope, and in brokenness there is the possibility of salvation. 
     His legacy endures not only in the pages of his masterpieces but in the countless hearts and minds he continues to move across 
     generations</em>.</p>
